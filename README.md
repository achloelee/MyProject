Hi welcome to my individual project. This data was retrieved on December 12th, 2021. BLS.gov cannot vouch for the data or analyses derived from these data after the data have been retrieved from BLS.gov.

This project was created to apply the subjects I learned from my Relational Database and Webpage design class. I brought together my knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and web access to databases to create a dynamic visualization of employment statistics from the U.S. Department of Labor Statistics using version 2 of the Department of Labor Statistics data API.
